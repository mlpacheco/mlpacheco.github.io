## CSCI 7000: Neuro-Symbolic Approaches to NLP

**Instructor**: Maria L. Pacheco<br>
**Class times**: Tue/Thu 11:00-12:15 am<br>
**Class location:** ECCR 1B55<br>
**Office hours:** TBD

### Course Description and Learning Objectives

The goal of neuro-symbolic methods is to combine symbolic representations and neural networks to benefit from the complementary strengths of the two paradigms. 
These ideas have a long history in AI and currently experience a resurgence of interest in several AI communities, including Natural Language Processing. 
In this class, we will survey and discuss foundational and emerging literature on neuro-symbolic representations as applied to natural language processing 
and computational linguistics. The main goal of this class is to provide students with a framework for analyzing the different modeling and algorithmic choices 
when combining symbolic and neural models for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning, building a base
from which students can go on to do research in these areas. 

The bulk of the class will be dedicated to paper reading, presentations and discussion.
Each student should expect to present one research paper during the semester. Students will also need to write a short paper review (1 or 2 paragraphs) in
the form of comments and questions and post it on Piazza before each paper discussion. There will be a course project, in which students will work in groups to design
and carry out a research project or a paper reproduction project related to neuro-symbolic NLP.

### Pre-requisites

This class assumes that students have taken a graduate-level AI/Machine Learning/NLP class or have acquired equivalent experience. 
Students should also be comfortable with at least one programming language.

### Grading

- Course project: 35\%
- Paper reviews: 25\%

### Assignments in More Detail

#### Paper Reviews

For each lecture, students should expect to read one research paper on a specific topic in
Neuro-Symbolic NLP. For each required paper reading, students need to submit a short paper review (1 or 2
paragraphs) in the form of questions or comments on Piazza before the class. The
grading of the paper review will depend on the overall quality of the
questions and/or comments. As you read a paper and write your review, focus on the
following perspectives:

- **Motivation of the work:** What are the research questions this study paper to answer? How important is the problem that the paper aims to address? 
Who will care about the findings and why should they care?
- **Novelty and significance of the work:** What was new at the time of publication? What are the main contributions of the paper? 
What did you find most interesting?
- **Limitations, flaws, and blind spots:** Is the research question ill defined? Does the paper fail to deliver on its promise? Are there any unrealistic or false
assumptions about the goal or target domain? Are there flaws or mistakes in the technical approach or experimental design?
- **Future work:** How would you improve on this work? Does this paper inspire any new ideas in your own research?

**Reviews are due at 9 am before the class, no late submissions allowed.**

#### Paper Presentation

Each student should expect to present one research paper during the course. The instructor will
ask students to sign up for papers by the end of the first day of class. The instructor
will present any unselected papers during the course.
Each paper presentation should take no more than 40 minutes, so that we can have enough
time for discussion. The presentation should elaborate on the motivation, related
work, research questions, methodology/experimental design, findings, limitations, and future work stated in the
paper. To make your presentation more insightful, try to position the paper contribution with respect to the related literature and tell the audience why this work was proposed in
the first place, how it advances our understanding about the topic, and how it is
different from other related work in the past. You are also encouraged to connect the
assigned paper to your own research. You should prepare a set of questions (either
written by yourself or based on questions other students post on Piazza) and co-lead
an in-class discussion with the instructor after the presentation.

#### In-Class Discussions

The in-class discussion will follow the think-pair-share format.
- **Think**. The presentor or the instructor will provoke students' thinking with a
question. The students should take one or two minutes just to THINK about the
question.
- **Pair**. Using designated partners (such as with Clock Buddies), nearby
neighbors, or a deskmate, students PAIR up to talk about their answers with
each other. They compare their mental or written notes and identify the answers
they think are best, most convincing, or most unique.
- **Share**. After students talk in pairs for a few minutes, the presenter or instructor
will call for pairs to SHARE their thinking with the rest of the class.

#### Course Project

Students are expected to work on a course project either alone or in groups (no more than 3
students in a group). There are two options for projects: 

##### 1) Research Projects

Students can pick any topics related to NLP as long as they incorporate at least one symbolic and one distributed component in the method design. Between Week 1 and Week 5, students should make sure to stop by
during office hours to discuss project ideas with the instructor and get early feedback
on the relevance, novelty, feasibility, and significance of the ideas. Students are encouraged to use this class to advance their own research, so it is perfectably acceptable to present ongoing individual research work as part of the course project as long as it is relevant to the class.

##### 2) Paper Reproduction Projects 

Students can select an existing, published, experimental paper and carry out a reproduction study. The paper does not need to be from the class reading list, as long as it is relevant to the topics covered in this class. The objective is to assess if the experiments are reproducible, and to determine if the conclusions of the paper are supported by your findings. Your results can be either positive (i.e. confirm reproducibility), or negative (i.e. explain what you were unable to reproduce, and potentially explain why). I suggest that you first attempt to reimplement the experiments of the paper from scratch. Using any published code is allowed, as long as this is clear in your report. I recommend that you focus on the central claim of the paper. Note that exact reproducibility is in most cases very difficult due to minor implementation details, results that are close to those in the original paper are enough for a positive conclusion. You do not need to reproduce all experiments in your selected paper, but only those that you feel are sufficient for you to verify the validity of the central claim. 

**Just re-running code is not a reproducibility study**, and you need to approach any code with critical thinking and verify it does what is described in the paper and that these are sufficient to support the conclusions of the papers. I suggest that you take a look at the [ML Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022) for guidelines and resources on how to carry out good reproducility research. Between Week 1 and Week 5, students should make sure to stop by
during office hours to get early feedback on their paper choice. 

##### Course Project Grading: 

- **Project Proposal**: A short project proposal is due on Sun. Sep 31 at midnight (Week 5). This proposal is worth 5\% of your overall grade. 
The proposal should be no longer than 2 pages (minus references) and include the following sections:
   1. **Title** for your project (this can also change later on).
   2. **Introduction** section, which should explain the context of the paper. It should contain the following information:<br>
      1. _Task / Research Question Description_: For research projects, what is the task you are trying to solve or what is the research question you are trying to answer? For reproduction studies, what does the original paper propose and which claims are you wanting to verify?<br>
      2. _Motivation & Limitations of existing work_: Have others tried to solve the same task or answer a similar research question? What are you/they trying to do differently and why? What were the limitations or shortcomings of prior work?<br>
      3. _Likely challenges and mitigations_: What is hard about this task / research question? What are your contingency plans if the reproduction turns out to be harder than expected or experiments do not go as planned?
   3. **Related Work Section**: Include 3-4 sentence descriptions of no less than 4 papers directly relevant to the proposed research. Also mention how the paper you are working on differs from these.

-  **Mid-Point Project Report**: A mid-point project summary is due on Sun. Oct 29 at midnight (Week 9). This summary is worth 10\% of your overall grade. The report should be no longer than 4 pages (minus references) and it should include the following sections:
     1. **Title**: Can include any revisions to your previous title.
     2. **Introduction**: Can include any revisions to your previous introduction.
     4. **Methodology Section**: For research projects, this section should describe the envisioned approach/methodology. For reproduction projects, this summary should include a road map for the reproduction study. i.e., a detailed description of which methods you are going to re-implement from scratch and what existing resources you are re-using (if any). 
     5. **Experimental Section**: a description of the experimental setup and any preliminary results obtained.

- **Final Project Presentation**: In Weeks 15 and 16, each team will deliver a presentation of their project. The presentation will be about 20 minutes + 5 minutes for Q&A. The presentation is worth 10\% of your total grade.

- **Final Report**: A final report is due on Sun. Dec 20 at midnight. This report should be no longer than 8 pages (minus references) and it is worth 10\% of your overall grade. Your final project report should be built upon your proposal and project summary. Feel free to
reuse sections from those two reports in your final report. You may include an appendix beyond 8 pages, but your paper must be understandable without it. Submissions should be in the ACL format. Your final report should be structured like a conference paper. It should contain:
  1. Title
  2. Abstract
  3. A well-motivated introduction
  4. Related work with proper citations
  5. Description of your methodology
  6. Experimental results
  7. Discussion of your findings and limitations.
  8. Conclusions and future work

Please include a link to your code in your final report. Please also add a README file in your repository to describe how to run and test your code.

#### Quizzes

We will have five quizzes during this course. Each quiz will assess your understanding
of the research topics that we have covered in the previous two or three weeks. The
quizzes will include multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. To prepare for
the quizzes, make sure that you (1) have read the papers, (2) have attended the presentations and/or reviewed the slides from the paper presenter, (3) understand the methodologies, findings, and
contributions of each paper. The instructor cannot accommodate quizzes on a different
date. Each quiz will take 10 minutes.

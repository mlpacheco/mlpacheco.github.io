## CSCI 7000: Neuro-Symbolic Approaches to NLP

**Instructor**: Maria L. Pacheco<br>
**Class times**: Tue/Thu 11:00-12:15 am<br>
**Class location:** ECCR 1B55<br>
**Office hours:** TBD

### Course Description and Learning Objectives

The goal of neuro-symbolic methods is to combine symbolic representations and neural networks to benefit from the complementary strengths of the two paradigms. 
These ideas have a long history in AI and currently experience a resurgence of interest in several AI communities, including Natural Language Processing. 
In this class, we will survey and discuss foundational and emerging literature on neuro-symbolic representations as applied to natural language processing 
and computational linguistics. The main goal of this class is to provide students with a framework for analyzing the different modeling and algorithmic choices 
when combining symbolic and neural models for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning, building a base
from which students can go on to do research in these areas. 

The bulk of the class will be dedicated to paper reading, presentations and discussion.
Each student should expect to present one research paper during the semester. Students will also need to write a short paper review (1 or 2 paragraphs) in
the form of comments and questions and post it on Piazza before each paper discussion. There will be a course project, in which students will work in groups to design
and carry out a research project or a paper reproduction project related to neuro-symbolic NLP.

### Pre-requisites

This class assumes that students have taken a graduate-level AI/Machine Learning/NLP class or have acquired equivalent experience. 
Students should also be comfortable with at least one programming language.

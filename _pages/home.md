I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). In Fall 2023, I will join the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) as an Assistant Professor. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. [Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/).


I primarly work on Natural Language Processing. My research vision centers humans and society in the development of language technologies. From a modeling perspective, I am interested in the integration of human expertise and statistical models. From an applied perspective, I am mostly interested in the relationship between language and social systems. Most of my previous work has focused on (deep) relational learning, and its application for analyzing political discourse, argumentation and narratives. I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. I actively collaborate with researchers in linguistics, security, human-computer interaction, and the behavioral and social sciences. 


**I will be looking for PhD students to start in Fall 2023**. Please, reach out if you think we could be a good match. For more details, take a look at my [research statement](https://mlpacheco.github.io/files/mlpacheco_research_statement.pdf), and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMDD9kgVKJA).

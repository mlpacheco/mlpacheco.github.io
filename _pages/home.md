### About Me

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/), and a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). In Fall 2023, I will move to a tenure-track Assistant Professor position at CU Boulder. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. [Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). 


### My Work

I primarily work on Natural Language Processing. I am mostly interested in the integration of structured knowledge and statistical models, and in the relationship between language and social systems. Most of my previous work has focused on [structured prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.100/) and [(deep) statistical relational learning](https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.7/), and their application for analyzing [public discourse](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.427/), [argumentation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.783/) and [narratives](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.446/). I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. I actively collaborate with researchers in linguistics, security, human-computer interaction, and the behavioral and social sciences. 


**I am looking for PhD students to start in Fall 2023**. For more details, take a look at my [research statement](https://mlpacheco.github.io/files/mlpacheco_research_statement.pdf), and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMDD9kgVKJA). If you think that we could be a good match, [apply to CU](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/graduate-admissions/how-apply) and mention my name in your application. I will carefully consider all applications of prospective students interested in working with me. However, I might not be able to reply to all prospective students email. For more thoughts on this, I recommend Prof. Yonatan Bisk's notes on [cold emailing professors](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html).

### About Me

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/), and a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). In Fall 2023, I will move to a tenure-track Assistant Professor position at CU Boulder. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. [Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). Prior to joining Purdue, I worked as a software engineer and data scientist for various startups in Caracas, Venezuela, where I was born and raised. I hold a BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Universidad Simon Bolivar. 


### My Work

I primarily work on Natural Language Processing. My research vision centers humans and society in the development and application of language technologies. I am mostly interested in the integration of human expertise and statistical models, and in the relationship between language and social systems. Most of my previous work has focused on structured prediction and (deep) statistical relational learning, and their application for analyzing public discourse, argumentation and narratives. I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. I actively collaborate with researchers in linguistics, security, human-computer interaction, and the behavioral and social sciences. 


**I will be looking for PhD students to start in Fall 2023**. Please, reach out if you think we could be a good match.

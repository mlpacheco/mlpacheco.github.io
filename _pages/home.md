I am a Postdoctoral Researcher [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). In Fall 2023, I will join the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) of as an Assistant Professor. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. [Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/)


My research focuses broadly on neural-symbolic methods to model natural language. From a modeling perspective, I am interested in the integration of structured knowledge and distributed language representations. From an applied perspective, I am mostly interested in discourse analysis and computational social science. Most of my previous work has focused on analyzing political discourse, argumentation and narratives using neural-symbolic representations. I am also actively involved in a few collaborations with systems and security researchers on projects leveraging NLP for systems applications. I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. Whenever appropriate, I ground my NLP work in relevant conceptual frameworks and theories developed in other disciplines (e.g. communication, social psychology).


**I will be looking for PhD students to start in Fall 2023**. Please, reach out if you think we could be a good match. For more details, take a look at my [research statement](https://mlpacheco.github.io/files/mlpacheco_research_statement.pdf), and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMDD9kgVKJA).

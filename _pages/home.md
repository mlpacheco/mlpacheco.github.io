### About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/), where I lead the [Boulder Language and Social Technologies](https://blast-cu.github.io/) group. Before joining CU, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), and my BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Universidad Simon Bolivar](http://www.usb.ve/) in Caracas, Venezuela, where I was born and raised.

I am also an active organizer for [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/) and [LatinX in AI](https://www.latinxinai.org/).


### My Work

I primarily work on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am mostly interested in the integration of structured knowledge and statistical models, and in the relationship between language and social systems. Most of my previous work has focused on [structured prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.100/) and [(deep) statistical relational learning](https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.7/), and their application for analyzing [public discourse](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.427/), [argumentation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.783/) and [narratives](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.446/). I am a strong believer in interdisciplinary, collaborative work. I actively collaborate with researchers in linguistics, security, human-computer interaction, bioinformatics, and the behavioral and social sciences.

### Interested in working with me?

- **If you are a student at CU** come talk to me about your research interests and ideas!
- **If you are prospective PhD student** please [apply to CU](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/graduate-admissions/how-apply) and mention my name in your application. I will carefully consider all applications of prospective students interested in working with me. However, I might not be able to reply to all prospective students email. For more thoughts on this, I recommend Prof. Yonatan Bisk's notes on [cold emailing professors](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html). 
- I do not have positions available for students outside of CU.
